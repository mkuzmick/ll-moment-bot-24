To start, obviously, it's, you know, the problem feels like it, of course, needs solving. And there appears to be kind of various different aspects of our business plan that we'd like to potentially incorporate. But juggling those feels sort of difficult. And obviously, like the practicality of of some of the components feels tricky as well. So we were curious what your what your thoughts were and initial, I guess, what your initial insight is.\n And so, yeah, thank you."},{"role":"assistant","content":""}]}

It's definitely a significant need. The reason it hasn't been solved is because it's really hard to solve. So I think it's a good thing for the team to work on, even though it's that hard because it's a big deal. So good. Good choice. The food desert phenomenon is something that the major retailers would really like to solve.\n Walmart has tried Kroger has tried, but what seems to keep getting in the way is the cost of the logistics, the physical supply and maintenance of supply and the difficult place to deliver and a difficult place to attract employees. And more recently, the very difficult problem with theft. One of the challenge, one of the folks I knew that tried basically people just came in with big shopping bags and filled them with everything and walked out.\n The employees are instructed not to confront them because they don't want any shootings or stabbings, and the police won't protect those areas. And so you see it going on more broadly in San Francisco now with whole retailers closing their stores. So I think it comes down to can you leverage existing infrastructure somehow to solve this problem? And it's it's related a little bit to the same issues the Team three is going to face.\n But when I've thought about this in the context of the other plans, I've looked at, I've always come back to all the pieces are actually there. So the actual supply exists and the retailers that would like to get it into these places, the demand is definitely there. The new ingredient that I think changes things is the availability of Uber, Lyft and unrelated drivers who have a lot of downtime, and you've seen them try to consume that downtime with package delivery and all sorts of things.\n And so if I were aiming the business plan at it now, I would try to figure out how to do it with no store and 100% existing capabilities. When I was in Boston, we worked a little bit with Roots Place for battered women over in Boston, and they had a food bank going there and they had the ability to deliver more feed to more people, but no infrastructure to do it.\n And so I'd look to existing food banks. I think the retailers will cooperate."}]}

Because somehow you have to deliver food cheaper than the best in the world people like Walmart and Kroger do in their grocery stores, and I think that's a good challenge for you all to look at and talk to some of those folks and say, Would you be willing to supply us at all of your wholesale cost or below if you were to figure out how to solve this problem?\n It's it's a big deal. And so it's a perfect one for this class. Or more questions?"}]}

So one company that I'd seen before, which I thought was sort of interesting and I'm curious what your take is on this. But there is I think a few companies have done this, but one of them is called free water and they basically like give water up for free and use the label of the water as like advertising.\n So I kind of the initial thought was maybe there's some way, whether it's like delivery on the actual packaging of the food, especially if you're sending it out to so many people, ideally. Right. To potentially use some sort of like advertising to help lower the costs. I was curious what your thoughts were on that."},{"role":"assistant","content":""}]}

The problem is when you add in advertising, you increase costs because it's an additional layer of advertising. And even digital advertising has gotten very expensive. The the solutions I've seen in these locations and cities is where there's a champion, an individual really believes who lives there and rallies the kids in the neighborhood, if you will, and maybe even this last mile distribution.\n But one of the things that seems to work best around education, food, scarcely all the rest in these physical locations is an individual who lives there who will put it all together on the ground. But more importantly, and this actually works for a lot of the crime problems in the inner city knows every family and every kid on their block or series of blocks and talks to them.\n If you can find those people and ask them how they would do this, that would be a fascinating point of learning as well, because there's one block in Harlem in the worst parts of Harlem where 100% of the kids are going to college and none of them are getting into games or violence. And it's because of one man who lives there who makes a point of knowing every family and every kid and mentoring one.\n And that's just his passion. And there are people like that in these places and so they will have the most knowledge of how to solve a problem like this. The other thing you'll hear when you talk to people on the ground and this is a cultural phenomenon that's emerged, is the people who are living at McDonald's and Burger King, etc., don't perceive there's a problem.\n They've got food, it's enough calories, which is their measure, not nutrition. And they can afford it. And there are hundreds of ways to convert your snap money into cash to to buy their Georges famous for the case of Coke costing $20. And it's because cases of Coke are the currency for converting snap into cash you go you can spend a snap on Coca-Cola.\n So you buy go buy a dozen cases of Coca-Cola and you take it to this guy and he converts of the cash at about half the value. But then you can buy whatever you want with the cash."}]}

Yeah. And so you got to figure out whether that broke even or not. But for the purpose of the class, I wouldn't get distracted by that. But write down that you might try to do this, but you don't know whether it works.\n But move on to this core issue of how do you how do you get at this problem? I, I worked with helped launch a startup called Food Friends here in Colorado that came out of Colorado State University. And it was people in the nutrition department working with some others, and they created puppets that were the foods and extolled the bad virtues of themselves.\n And it was it was pretty effective because they took it to the schools and had the schools use it as teaching material. And they let the kids take the puppets form and teach their parents. Because the parents see the problem. They don't know any of this. So the idea was to skip the generation, train the kids who will then tell their parents, No, I don't want you to fix all these every day.\n It's not healthy and so you got to see if the friends are still going. We launched that probably 12 or 15 years ago, but that's another example with somebody trying to get at the root cause of the problem, which was lack of education of the children or lack of knowledge of their parents."}]}

A lot of these areas have significant gang presence and you got to know where you can and cannot go attack, not accidentally interrupt whatever it is that's going on and or hire those people to be your local delivery people. But that's that introduces danger for your employees in doing that.\n So I think safety and security, I think second is cost in that with retail food, they really have reduced the cost of food to its almost bare minimum. So if you take Kroger as an example at the store level for a Kroger store, the average retail margin is about four and a half percent. So that's how much money they're making at the store level.\n And so the most efficient they can be, it's harder to tell at Wal Mart, which is actually the largest grocer in the country, but doesn't get reported as such because it sells other things. But you're competing against the best in the world company having a four and a half percent margin, then you're trying to lower the cost from there.\n Extremely difficult to do. So the answer might lie in how you package multiple things, because when you package multiple things, it can capture that cost and let them meet the cost. So Corbett did us a favor in that most places have delivery and or pickup maybe to cut a deal with Kroger or Wal Mart to pre package for a household just like they would do packaging for delivery or pickup and sell it to you at their normal retail cost.\n And then you could find a donor way funded way to do the last mile delivery into these places. You could build a website talked about where people specify what they want and maybe use your software to sort through that and try to make it healthier, make healthier recommendations, somehow be able to be swapped. So next time try this.\n It's healthy or try this. You know, the store brand is cheaper than Oreos sort of thing, and then sort of lean them that way. And if you get the kids in the neighborhoods being served to ride their bikes out, you pick up those deliveries and bring them to the households. So so that's it. So cost is number two.\n Number three is you absolutely cannot afford a retail from third is you can't afford the rent, you can't afford the electricity, you can't afford the cooling. So putting a physical space there is a loss leader for some groups in major European cities. They've done it with these pop up shops, but it doesn't seem to work in the US nearly as well.\n So yeah, it's a hard one. That's why I think it's good to put your minds on it and see if you can come up with an approach and flesh it out. And as I said in my earlier talk, even if you discover it doesn't work, it's worth trying and there's no shame and saying, we really try to find a way to make this work and here's why.\n That's to me, that's a great use of the canvas because you put it down and you get to look at it and say, okay, it doesn't work. Is there anything we've learned, any way to redesign this business so that it works and that will point you towards the fundraising side of saying who's really interested in doing this? But for PR purposes, it gets you into the municipal or city funding mechanisms to say who in the city might actually have programs that would pay for some of this to offset costs.\n And there's a significant amount of money available if somebody can solve this problem. And so, yeah, it's it's it's worth trying to figure it out. As I say, look at the models, see why it's not working. Come up with what you know, you guess the financial gap is going to be and you can almost use percentages to say, you know, somehow we're going to be adding five, 8% of the cost of all retail costs, of all the food to pull this off.\n How do we capture that five or 8% and pay the pay the price to the supplier that does that does all the logistics include, thankfully for us, for free, if you were to show Kroger how to do this or Wal-Mart how to do this, they would copy it. So when the good the good can happen."}]}

I might go talk to a store manager at a Kroger local corporate, go for a store manager and say that we're student team. We're thinking about doing this idea.\n Is there a way to deliver to leverage your existing pickup to do this better and talk to a couple of them and see what their ground level impression is. If you know anybody in any of these neighborhoods, I'd go into the neighborhood and ask them, you know, is there somebody you will think could organize this a ground level to make it work and see if you can come up with the name of somebody like in Harlem.\n The guy's name is Geoffrey Canada, and he's he's become reasonably famous. But, you know, his idea seems to work. And so you can research Geoffrey Canada and what he did to get all the kids on this block in Harlem to go to college. And actually, it's not so much going to college. It's it's mentally being ready to go to college because they can go to college pretty much for free.\n It's at the university, but they've very few of them think they could ever go to college unless acted on by an outside force.
